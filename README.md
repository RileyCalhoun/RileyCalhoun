btw, my wife is beautiful (did i mention that i have a wife?)

Based in Hanford, California. Attending College of the Sequoias in Visalia, majoring in Computer Science and Math.
Math is cool, coding is fun. I'll make a lot of money some day.

Languages:
- Rust (best programming language)
- Java (worst programming language)
- Javascript (the actual worst programming language)
- A little bit of Go, learning it
- A teeny tiny bit of Python (please lord don't ask me to code in this)
