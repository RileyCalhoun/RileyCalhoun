btw, my wife is beautiful (did i mention that i have a wife?)

Based in Hanford, California. Attending College of the Sequoias in Visalia, majoring in Computer Science and Math.
Coding stresses me out, but it's also really fun. I hate refactoring my code. Never ask me to do it.

Languages:
- Rust (best programming language)
- Java (worst programming language)
- Javascript (the actual worst programming language)
- A little bit of Go, learning it
- A teeny tiny bit of Python (please lord don't ask me to code in this)
